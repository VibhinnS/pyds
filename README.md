# Python Project Template

This project is a template for creating Python projects that follows the Python Standards declared in PEP 621. It uses a pyproject.yaml file to configure the project and Flit to simplify the build process and publish to PyPI. Flit simplifies the build and packaging process for Python projects by eliminating the need for separate setup.py and setup.cfg files. With Flit, you can manage all relevant configurations within the pyproject.toml file, streamlining development and promoting maintainability by centralizing project metadata, dependencies, and build specifications in one place.

## Project Organization

- `.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions used for building, testing, and publishing.
- `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`: Contains Dockerfile to build a development container for VSCode with all the necessary extensions for Python development installed.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Contains the configuration for the development container for VSCode, including the Docker image to use, any additional VSCode extensions to install, and whether or not to mount the project directory into the container.
- `.vscode/settings.json`: Contains VSCode settings specific to the project, such as the Python interpreter to use and the maximum line length for auto-formatting.
- `src`: Place new source code here.
- `tests`: Contains Python-based test cases to validate source code.
- `pyproject.toml`: Contains metadata about the project and configurations for additional tools used to format, lint, type-check, and analyze Python code.
